Once you have selected your data set for the project, copy the files for that dataset here - specifically the README and any csv files, but NOT the containing folder.

Make sure you ADD your data files to Git by right-clicking on each one and selecting  Git -> Add. 

Then, Commit and Push, verifying that the data files are included.

Once your data has been added and committed, feel free to delete this file.
